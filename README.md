# stroke-prediction-ml
This **GitHub repository** serves as a digital storage space for a **machine learning** capstone project focused on **stroke prediction**. Created for the **ML Zoomcamp** course, the collection includes a **healthcare dataset** alongside the necessary **Python code** and **Jupyter notebooks** to train a predictive model. The technical setup is supported by files for **containerisation** via Docker and **cloud deployment** using AWS Lambda functions and API Gateway. Users can access specific scripts for **model training**, dependency management files, and the final **binary model** file. Overall, the source highlights a practical application of **data science** aimed at identifying medical risks through **automated analysis**.
